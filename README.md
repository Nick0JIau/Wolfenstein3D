# Wolfenstein3D
This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.

# Compiling
Run "make" and you're set. Runs on Mac OS X

# Running
Run "./wolf3d [maps/map_file]", a window should appear. You can navigate through the map using the arrow keys. Exit by closing the window or pressing ESC.

# Map file format
It's a very simple format. Open a file in your favorite text editor, make sure you have a grid of integers (each one being it's block ID), and it should work right out of the box. Spawn position is the first empty space available from the top left.
